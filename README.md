# note-expert
This is the repository for the Challenge 11 homework. This application allows the user to type in a title and body for a note, save each note, and refer back to old notes if desired. I am still working on the functionality of the delete button. The application was built using Javascript, Express, and Node.
Much of this project is made up of starter code provided by the UCSD Bootcamp. I do not own any of the starter code. Route methods were learned from past projects and promisify methods were learned through peer discussion.
